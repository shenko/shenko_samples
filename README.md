## Installation (Cross-Platform)

This project can be set up on Linux, macOS, Windows, and even Android (using a terminal emulator like Termux).

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Prerequisite:** Ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) installed on your system. Git works on all major platforms.

2.  **Open your Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    *   **Linux:** Usually called Terminal, Konsole, xterm, etc.
    *   **macOS:** Called Terminal (found in `/Applications/Utilities/`).
    *   **Windows:** Called Command Prompt (cmd), PowerShell, or Git Bash (if installed with Git).
    *   **Android:** Requires a terminal app like [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/).

3.  **Clone the repository:** In your terminal/command prompt, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shenko/shenko_samples.git
    ```
    *(This command downloads the project files from GitHub to your computer)*

4.  **Navigate to the directory:** Change into the newly created project folder using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd shenko_samples
    ```

That's it! You now have the project files on your local machine, regardless of your operating system.
